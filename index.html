  <p>Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Computer, lights up! Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone I guess it's better to be lucky than good. How long can two people talk about nothing? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Travel time to the nearest starbase?</p>
