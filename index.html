  <h1>Jason Kennedy</h1>
  <p>The unexpected is our normal routine. I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral.</p>
