    <h2 class="article-title">Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <h3>What is it?</h3>
    <p>Progressive enhancement is a principle of web design, where sites are built in layers on top of a basic piece of content that is compatible with all browsers and accessible to everyone. The core of progressive enhancement is building the content first. The name “progressive enhancement” comes from the idea that users with more advanced systems can enjoy progressively enhanced experiences as they employ more technologies (such as CSS and JavaScript) to view the page. Progressive enhancement is about structuring information and functionality that can stand on its own, and building optional visuals and user experiences on top of the content.</p>

    <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
    <p>One of the oldest challenges in web development is figuring out how to build sites that work on both older and newer browsers. A site built for up-to-date browsers might have serious problems on older browsers that lack support for the newest features and standards. Worst case, the site might break completely on old browsers.</p>
    <p>Faced with this dilemma, developers had to make a choice. Many decided that new browsers would get the best experience, and that they would make sure that it would at least not break on older browsers. This follows an old engineering principle that if a system breaks, it should do so in a way that gives the user a soft landing. They call this “graceful degradation.” </p>
    <p>It turns out that the graceful degradation approach has a lot of problems. Instead of building sites that are meant to last, it encourages using the most current technologies, while looking backwards to do some damage control. It can produce sites that do a bad job of running on older technology, while also not being future-proof. The rise of smartphones created an unexpected need for simpler websites, and progressive degradation did a poor job of handling this development. </p>
    <p>The hope is that progressive enhancement will produce websites that are future-proof and accessible to everyone, while still allowing designers to build cutting edge websites. </p>

    <p>The British Government used progressive enhancement in building their official websites, and <a href="https://technology.blog.gov.uk/2016/09/19/why-we-use-progressive-enhancement-to-build-gov-uk/">they were kind enough to provide a nice writeup</a> that explains the benefits of this approach.</p>
    <p>Wikipedia has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement">a good article</a> on progressive enhancement, with some history and description.</p>

    <h2 class="article-title">Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
    <p>I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. I'll alert the crew. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. Well, that's certainly good to know. Besides, you look good in a dress. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. I am your worst nightmare! I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. I guess it's better to be lucky than good.</p>
    <p>The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. and attack the Romulans. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Your shields were failing, sir. For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. Shields up! Rrrrred alert! When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? This is not about revenge. This is about justice. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? The unexpected is our normal routine. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. Not if I weaken first. Sorry, Data. What?</p>
